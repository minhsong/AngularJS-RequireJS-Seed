#AngularJs RequireJs Karma seed Project

This repository holds the base files needed to quickly set up a RequireJs based AngularJs
Single Page Application (SPA). _check tags for stable downloads_

This seed app includes basic unit test setup with RequireJs (e2e tests coming soon), karma.cong file,
and a build file to run r.js for compilation/minification.

There are no e2e tests in this seed yet, but I inted to have that all set up in the next week.

#Why use this seed project instead of yeoman/yo seed generator?
Currently the yeoman/yo (v1.0 Beta) generator does not support AngularJs with RequireJs. You can have either an AngularJS
project or you can have a RequireJs project but you can't have both via yeoman/yo. :(


###I intend to port this over to yeoman/yo as a generator but for now I am hoping this will do.
